A person having clear concepts, knowledge of basic \\nterminologies as well as practical knowledge in the field can be successful.  \\nHere are 46 networking interview questions and answers given for your interview \\npreparation and  to clear the basic concepts of networking.  \\n1. What is Network?  \\nIt is a system where a set of computers or physical devices are connected by using single \\ntransmission technology. The computers/physical devices can communicate with each \\nother in a network. They can also send and receive information in that particular \\nnetwork.  \\n2. Where are destination and source address located in a frame?  \\nThe packet header includes destination and source addresses.  \\n3. What format is used for an internet packet?  \\nThe internet layer defines an official packet format and protocol called IP (Internet \\nProtocol). The job of the internet layer is to deliver IP packets where they are supposed \\nto go.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'networking-interview-questions-and-answers-pdf.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='NETWORKING INTERVIEW  QUESTIONS AND ANSWE RS  \\nExamPlanning.Com   \\n 2 4. A network administrator needs audio and video service for his network. \\nHe has to se nd or receive data at the same data rate. Which type of ATM \\nwould quality service specification be applied there? Give example?  \\nTo facilitate the transport of audio and video data across emerging Asynchronous \\nTransfer Mode (ATM) networks, a simple, low cos t, audio/video ATM appliance, the \\nAVATAR, has been developed. This appliance is capable of handling uncompressed \\nbidirectional audio and NTSC video connections.  \\n5. A network administrator wants to build a tunnel between sites offices. \\nHow will he build usi ng the private virtual network?  \\nTo establishes a private network that can send data securely between these two \\nlocations or networks through a \"tunnel.\" A VPN tunnel connects the two PCs or \\nnetworks and allows data to be transmitted over the Internet as if  it were still within \\nthose networks.  \\n6. How can we compute the shortest path in WAN?  \\nWe use Dijkstra\\'s algorithm to compute shortest path from each node to every other \\nnode.  \\n7. What type of switching technique is used in WAN?  \\nWANs can use circuit -switchi ng or packet -switching techniques. To span long distances \\nor many computers, networks must replace shared medium with packet switches. Each \\nswitch moves an entire packet from one connection to another.

What ty pe of topology used in Ethernet?'), Document(metadata={'source': 'networking-interview-questions-and-answers-pdf.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='NETWORKING INTERVIEW  QUESTIONS AND ANSWE RS  \\nExamPlanning.Com   \\n 3 Traditional Ethernet employs a bus topology, meaning that all devices or hosts on the \\nnetwork use the same shared communication line.  \\n9. Difference between LAN and WAN  \\nIn LAN network occupies the smaller area like a room a  floor or a building. In WAN, \\nnetwork occupies larger areas like cities & countries. The Internet is a Wide Area \\nNetwork.  \\n10. What is a bridge?  \\nA bridge is a hardware device also used to connect two LAN segments to extend a \\nLAN. A typical bridge has two NI Cs, a CPU a memory and a ROM. It only runs the \\ncode stored in its ROM.  \\n11. Defines simplex and full -duplex connection?  \\nSome connection -oriented technologies provide full duplex  while other allow on the \\nsimplex connection. To communicate using a simplex des ign a pair of computers must \\nestablish two connections one from computer A to computer B and another from \\ncomputer B to A.  \\n12. What is Multi -casting?  \\nIt works like broadcasting however it does not forward frames automatically to the \\nCPU. The interface hard ware is programmed in advance to accept certain frames that \\nhave a multicast address as the destination address.  \\n13. What is FDDI?'), Document(metadata={'source': 'networking-interview-questions-and-answers-pdf.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='NETWORKING INTERVIEW  QUESTIONS AND ANSWE RS  \\nExamPlanning.Com   \\n 4 Fiber distributed data interconnect (FDDI) is another ring technology. Its most \\nimportant features are i) It uses fiber optic s between stations and transmits data at \\n100Mbps, ii) It uses a pair of fibers to form two concentric rings.  \\n14. Define 802.11 Wireless LAN and CSMA?  \\nIEEE 802.11 is standard wireless LAN that uses radio signals at 2.4GHz. Its data rate is \\n11Mbps. The older devices use radio signals at 900MHz and data rate of 2Mbps. \\nBluetooth specifies a wireless LAN for short distances. It uses shared medium and radio \\nwaves instead of coaxial cable.  \\n15. What is static and dynamic routing?  \\nStatic routing is the simplest form of routing, but it is a manual process. Dynamic \\nrouting protocols are supported by software applications running on the routing device \\n(the router) w hich dynamically learn network destinations and how to get to them and \\nalso advertise those destinations to other routers.  \\n16. What are disadvantages of Repeaters?  \\nRepeaters do not recognize frame formats, they just amplify and retransmit the \\nelectrical s ignal. If a collision or error occurs in one segment, repeaters amplify and \\nretransmit also the error onto the other segments.  \\n17. What is 10base T?  \\nOne of several adaptations of the Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) standard for Local Area \\nNetworks (LANs). The 10Base -T standard (also called Twisted Pair Ethernet) uses a'), Document(metadata={'source': 'networking-interview-questions-and-answers-pdf.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='17. What is 10base T?  \\nOne of several adaptations of the Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) standard for Local Area \\nNetworks (LANs). The 10Base -T standard (also called Twisted Pair Ethernet) uses a \\ntwisted -pair cable with maximum lengths of 100 meters.  \\n18. Briefly describe the working structure of thick Ethernet.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'networking-interview-questions-and-answers-pdf.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='NETWORKING INTERVIEW  QUESTIONS AND ANSWE RS  \\nExamPlanning.Com   \\n 5 It uses thick coax cable. AUI cable (or transceiver or drop cable) connects from NI C to \\na transceiver. AUI cable carries digital signal from NIC to transceiver. The transceiver \\ngenerates an analog signal on the coax cable. The wires in AUI carry digital signals \\npower and other control signals. Thick Ethernet also requires terminators to avoid \\nsignal reflectance.  \\n19. What is the difference between Cells and Packets?  \\nATM designers chose cells over packets because of the following reasons:  \\n• Cells are not variable length and memory management for them is simpler. \\nHandling variable length packe ts leads to memory fragmentation.  \\n• Variable length packets require hardware to accommodate the largest possible \\npacket, and thus to detect the end of the packet. With cells, bits can just be \\ncounted as they arrive.  \\n• The length of time required to send a vari able length packet is variable and \\nrequires complicated interrupt scheme to detect completion of the transmission. \\nQoS can’t be guaranteed with variable length packets as easily as it can with fixed \\nlength cells.  \\n20. What is the difference between the phys ical and logical topologies?  \\nPhysical Topology:  The way that the workstations are connected to the network \\nthrough the actual cables that transmit data -- the physical structure of the network -- is \\ncalled the physical topology. It depends on the wiring sc heme.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'networking-interview-questions-and-answers-pdf.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='through the actual cables that transmit data -- the physical structure of the network -- is \\ncalled the physical topology.

We \\ncan say that it is defined by the specific network technology.  \\n21. What is meant by Bridges STARTUP and STEADY State?  \\nWhen a bridge first boots the address lists are empty (startup state). The bridge \\nforwards frames to the other segment if it cannot fin d its destination address in its lists. \\nAfter some time when the bridge has received at least one frame from every computer, \\nit has the lists built (steady state) it forwards frames as far it is necessary.  \\n22. What is the concept of packet switches?  \\nTo spa n long distances or many computers, networks must replace shared medium with \\npacket switches. Each switch moves an entire packet from one connection to another. \\nThat’s why they are called packet switches. A packet switch consists of a small \\ncomputer with n etwork interfaces, a memory and a program dedicated to packet \\nswitching function.  \\n23. Define Vector -Distance Algorithm.  \\nPacket switches wait for next update message and they iterate through entries in a \\nmessage. If an entry has the shortest path to the de stination, insert source as next hop \\nto the destination and record distance as distance from next hop to destination plus \\ndistance from this switch to next hop.  \\n24. What is the concept of store and forward technology?  \\nSTORE AND FORWARD:  Data delivery from  one computer to another is'), Document(metadata={'source': 'networking-interview-questions-and-answers-pdf.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='distance from this switch to next hop.  \\n24. What is the concept of store and forward technology?  \\nSTORE AND FORWARD:  Data delivery from  one computer to another is \\naccomplished through store and forward technology. In this technology, packet switch \\nstores incoming packet and also forwards that packet to another switch or computer.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'networking-interview-questions-and-answers-pdf.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='NETWORKING INTERVIEW  QUESTIONS AND ANSWE RS  \\nExamPlanning.Com   \\n 7 For this purpose, packet switch has internal memory into wh ich it can hold packet if an \\noutgoing connection is busy. Packets for each connection held on a queue.  \\n25. How can a bridge know whether to forward frames?  \\nThe bridges configure themselves automatically to decide which bridge will forward \\nbroadcast frames and which bridge will not. The bridges communicate with each other \\non the network and use Distributed Spanning Tree (DST) algorithm to decide which \\nbridge will not forward frames if a cycle occurs.  \\n26. Compare connection -oriented and connectionless Service.  \\n• In connection -oriented protocol, authentication is needed while this is not a case \\nin the connectionless protocol.  \\n• In connection -oriented protocol, we have to establish a connection between \\nsender  and receiver while this is not a case in the connectionless protocol.  \\n• Example of connection -oriented protocol is TCP and the example of a \\nconnectionless protocol is UDP, Internet.  \\n• TCP is a connection -oriented protocol, it makes a connection and checks \\nwhether the data is received, and resends if it is not. UDP is a connectionless \\nprotocol, it does not guarantee delivery by first connecting and checking whether \\ndata is received.  \\n27. ABC Company has a huge network of systems and switches. A task is \\ngiven to IT Officer that if some link goes the entire network works smoothly. \\nWhich routing method will be used?'), Document(metadata={'source': 'networking-interview-questions-and-answers-pdf.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='27. ABC Company has a huge network of systems and switches.

Ideally, the network operation, status, and architecture of each node is \\ntransparent. Distributed routing is more flexible than centralized routing because each \\nnode handles its own routing. The result is often improv ed system performance.  \\n28. Describe permanent virtual circuits (PVC).  \\nATM can provide customers with virtual circuits that look like traditional leased digital \\ncircuits. Such permanent virtual circuits (PVC) last as long as the customer pay the \\nperiodic fee for its use. The forwarding tables are automatically restored after the \\npower of equipment failure. The forwarding table entries for such permanent VC’s are \\nstatically configured, the terms used by Telco’s for this is provisioning. Provisioning \\nrequires two steps: 1. To determine a complete path (that is, identify the swit ches that \\nwill be used). 2. To choose appropriate VPI/VCI for each step in the path, and configure \\neach adjacent pair of switches (easy, since each switch rewrites the VCI/VPI).  \\n29. Give a comparison of wiring Schemes.  \\nThe wiring schemes are compared as fo llows: Separate transceiver allows computers to \\nbe powered off or disconnected from the network without disrupting other \\ncommunication. The transceiver may be located in an inconvenient place, so finely \\nmalfunction transceiver can be hard. In another case,  thin coax cable takes a minimum of'), Document(metadata={'source': 'networking-interview-questions-and-answers-pdf.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='communication. The transceiver may be located in an inconvenient place, so finely \\nmalfunction transceiver can be hard. In another case,  thin coax cable takes a minimum of \\ncable. Disconnecting one computer (on one loose connection) can disrupt entire \\nnetwork. Hub wiring centralizes electronics and connections. It makes management \\neasier. Bottom line 10Base -T is most popular because of lowe st cost.  \\n30. How can Switched Virtual Network be established?  \\nESTABLISHING AN SVC: The computer sends a connection request to the switch to \\nwhich it is attached. Software in the switch finds a network path to the destination and'), Document(metadata={'source': 'networking-interview-questions-and-answers-pdf.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='NETWORKING INTERVIEW  QUESTIONS AND ANSWE RS  \\nExamPlanning.Com   \\n 9 sends along the connection request. Each pair of switches in the path communicates to \\nchoose a VPI/VCI for their tables. Once the connection is established by the destination, \\na message is sent back to the originating computer to indicate the SVC is ready. If any \\nswitch or the desti nation computer does not agree to set up the VC, an error message \\nis sent back and the SVC is not established.  \\n31. We have two satellite locations, at first location one bridge is configured \\nand at a second location, 2 bridges are configured. Which locatio n \\nperformed will be faster?  \\nSatellite locations with two bridges configured will perform faster. The brigade also had \\nto provide power to virtually all of its East Timor assets. Setting up the satellite system, \\nfor example, required supplying power to bot h the communications station and the \\nusers’ computers. A bridge that has multiple ports is known as a networking switch. \\nBoth bridges and switches are capable of directing traffic to specific network addresses \\ninstead of broadcasting the data to all device s on a network segment. This functionality \\nmakes the bridge or switches a more advanced networking device over a hub or \\nrepeater.  \\n32. “To achieve a hierarchy, OSPF allows an autonomous system to be \\npartitioned for routing purposes”.

Does this feature make OSPF more \\ncomplex or powerful?  \\nOSPF allows an autonomous system to be partitioned for routing purposes which make \\nit complex but More powerful.  \\n33. Why does IPv6 use separate Extension Headers?'), Document(metadata={'source': 'networking-interview-questions-and-answers-pdf.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='NETWORKING INTERVIEW  QUESTIONS AND ANSWE RS  \\nExamPlanning.Com   \\n 10 IPv6 use separate Extension Headers. Fragmentation information  is kept in the separate \\nextension header. Each fragment has base header and (inserted) fragmentation header. \\nEntire datagram including original header may be fragmented.  \\n34. Write down the comparison of Distance - vector, and Link – state \\nalgorithm?  \\nDISTAN CE-VECTOR ROUTING:  \\n• It is very simple to implement.  \\n• Packet switch updates its own routing table first.  \\n• It is used in RIP.  \\nLINK -STATE ALGORITHM:  \\n• It is much more complex.  \\n• Switches perform independent computations.  \\n• It is used in OSPF.  \\n35. Write down characteristics of Routing Information Protocol(RIP)  \\nIt has the following characteristics:  \\n• It is used for routing within an autonomous system (IGP).  \\n• It uses UDP for all message transmissions.  \\n• It can be used to advertise default route propaga tion. An organization can use RIP \\nto install a default route in each router.  \\n• It uses distance vector algorithm.  \\n• RIP allows hosts to listen passively and update its routing table  \\n36. Describe some features of IPV6.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'networking-interview-questions-and-answers-pdf.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='NETWORKING INTERVIEW  QUESTIONS AND ANSWE RS  \\nExamPlanning.Com   \\n 11 • IPV6 addresses are 128 bits.  \\n• The header fo rmat is entirely different.  \\n• Additional information is stored in optional extension headers, followed by data.  \\n• Flow label and quality of service allow audio and video applications to establish \\nappropriate connections.  \\n• New features can be added more easily. So it is extensible.  \\n37. Comparison between TCP/IP reference model and ISO reference model?  \\n• The main differences between the two models are as follows:  \\n• TCP/IP combines the presentation and session layer issues into its application \\nlayer.  \\n• TCP/IP combines th e OSI data link and physical layers into the network access \\nlayer.  \\n• TCP/IP appears to be a simpler model and this is mainly due to the fact that it has \\nfewer layers.  \\n38. What is Address Resolution?  \\nMapping between a protocol address and a hardware address i s called Address \\nResolution. A host or router uses address resolution when it needs to send a packet to \\nanother computer on the same physical network. A computer never resolves the \\naddress of a computer that attaches to a remote network. In the figure belo w a simple \\nInternet with routers R1 & R2 connecting three physical networks is shown each \\nnetwork has two host computers attached.  \\n39.

Comparison between TCP/IP reference model and ISO reference model?  \\n• The main differences between the two models are as follows:  \\n• TCP/IP combines the presentation and session layer issues into its application \\nlayer.  \\n• TCP/IP combines th e OSI data link and physical layers into the network access \\nlayer.  \\n• TCP/IP appears to be a simpler model and this is mainly due to the fact that it has \\nfewer layers.  \\n38. What is Address Resolution?  \\nMapping between a protocol address and a hardware address i s called Address \\nResolution. A host or router uses address resolution when it needs to send a packet to \\nanother computer on the same physical network. A computer never resolves the \\naddress of a computer that attaches to a remote network. In the figure belo w a simple \\nInternet with routers R1 & R2 connecting three physical networks is shown each \\nnetwork has two host computers attached.  \\n39.
